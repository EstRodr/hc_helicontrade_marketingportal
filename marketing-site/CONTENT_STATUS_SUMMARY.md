## ‚ùå **Still Showing Empty**

### Website Pages Currently Display:
- Blog: "No articles yet"
- News: "No news available"  
- Features: Need to check if loading from Strapi

### Root Cause:
The Strapi content exists but the Nuxt pages aren't successfully fetching/displaying it.

## üîß **Next Steps to Fix**

### 1. Debug Blog/News Pages
- Check if `useStrapi()` composable is working on client-side
- Verify API calls are being made correctly
- Check browser console for any errors
- Test direct API calls from browser

### 2. Fix Hero Headline Personalization  
- Current issue: PersonalizedHero shows basic styled version
- Should show dynamic market-aware headlines from Strapi
- May need to adjust ClientOnly wrapper or server-side rendering

### 3. Features Page Integration
- Verify `/features` page is loading Strapi features
- Should replace static features with CMS-managed ones
- Test that featured vs regular features work correctly

## üéØ **Expected Final Result**

When fully working:
- **Blog**: Shows 3 articles with full content and links
- **News**: Shows 3 news items with categories and priorities  
- **Features**: Shows 6 features from Strapi (4 featured, 2 additional)
- **Homepage**: Dynamic hero headlines based on market status
- **All pages**: Fast loading with server-side Strapi content

## üîç **Debug Commands**

```bash
# Test Strapi API directly
curl "http://142.132.205.187/api/articles" -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# Check if pages are making API calls  
curl "http://localhost:3001/blog" | grep "Loading\|No articles"

# Test browser console for errors
# Visit: http://localhost:3001/blog and check dev tools
```

The content is successfully created in Strapi - we just need to fix the frontend data fetching to display it properly.
