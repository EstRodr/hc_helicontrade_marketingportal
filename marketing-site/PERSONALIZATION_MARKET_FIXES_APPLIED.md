# Personalization Market Fixes Applied

## Issues Addressed

### ‚úÖ 1. Country Adjective Mapping
**Problem**: "Spain markets" instead of "Spanish markets"
**Solution**: Expanded `getCountryAdjective()` function to include comprehensive global mappings:
- Added Spain ‚Üí Spanish
- Added 50+ other countries and their proper adjectives
- Fallback to original country name if mapping not found

### ‚úÖ 2. Market Name Mapping  
**Problem**: Wrong market labels like "OMX" for Spain instead of "BME/IBEX"
**Solution**: Updated market mapping system:
- Unified all market lookups to use the comprehensive `MARKET_MAP` 
- Fixed Spain mapping: `ES` ‚Üí `BME` exchange with `IBEX` index
- Added 50+ global markets with correct names and indices
- Removed conflicting `getMarketSchedule` simple mappings

### ‚úÖ 3. Function Parameter Updates
**Problem**: `getMarketSchedule` only received country name, not country code
**Solution**: Updated all calls to pass both country and countryCode:
```typescript
const { marketOpen, marketClose, marketName } = getMarketSchedule(country, countryCode)
```

### ‚úÖ 4. Debug Logging Added
Added comprehensive market status debugging to track:
- Country detection (name and code)
- Market mapping resolution  
- Market session detection
- Time formatting

## Expected Results

### For Spain (ES):
- Country: "Spain" ‚Üí Adjective: "Spanish" 
- Market: "BME" (not "OMX")
- Index: "IBEX" (not default indices)
- Proper Spanish market hours (9:00-17:30)

### For Other Global Markets:
- Correct market names (NYSE, TSE, LSE, etc.)
- Proper country adjectives (German, French, Japanese, etc.)  
- Accurate local market indices and hours

## Testing Steps

1. Open marketing site homepage
2. Check browser console for market debug logs:
   ```
   üè¢ Market status debug: {
     country: "Spain",
     countryCode: "ES", 
     marketName: "BME",
     session: "market-open",
     isOpen: true
   }
   ```
3. Verify personalized headlines show:
   - "Spanish markets" (not "Spain markets")
   - "BME" references (not "OMX") 
   - Correct city detection

## Files Modified

- `/composables/usePersonalization.ts`:
  - Expanded `getCountryAdjective()` function
  - Updated `getMarketSchedule()` to use comprehensive MARKET_MAP
  - Modified `setLocalizedMarketStatus()` to pass countryCode parameter
  - Added debug logging throughout market detection

## Next Steps

1. Test with Spanish IP/location 
2. Verify correct market labels appear in all personalized content
3. Check market timing accuracy for Spanish market hours
4. Test other global markets to ensure no regressions

## Location Detection Notes

The location detection works via:
1. IP geolocation (most accurate for city) 
2. Browser timezone fallback
3. Browser locale fallback  

For precision issues with city detection, the IP geolocation service (ipapi.co) should provide accurate city-level location data.
