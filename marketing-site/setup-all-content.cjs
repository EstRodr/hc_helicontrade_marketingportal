    content: `# Master These 5 Trading Patterns

Understanding chart patterns is crucial for successful trading. Here are the 5 most reliable patterns that our AI actively monitors.

## 1. Head and Shoulders

A reversal pattern that signals the end of an uptrend.

**What to look for:**
- Three peaks, with the middle one being the highest
- Equal volume on both shoulders
- Break below the neckline for confirmation

## 2. Double Top/Bottom

Strong reversal patterns that indicate trend changes.

**Double Top characteristics:**
- Two peaks at approximately the same level
- Significant decline between peaks
- Break below support confirms reversal

## 3. Triangle Patterns

Continuation patterns that signal the trend will resume.

**Types:**
- **Ascending Triangle**: Bullish continuation
- **Descending Triangle**: Bearish continuation
- **Symmetrical Triangle**: Breakout direction unclear

## 4. Cup and Handle

A bullish continuation pattern resembling a tea cup.

**Formation:**
- Initial decline (cup formation)
- Rounding bottom
- Small pullback (handle)
- Breakout above resistance

## 5. Flag Patterns

Short-term continuation patterns after strong moves.

**Bull Flag:**
- Strong upward move (flagpole)
- Small consolidation (flag)
- Breakout continues uptrend

## How AI Helps

Our AI can spot these patterns automatically across thousands of assets simultaneously, alerting you to high-probability setups 24/7.`,

The difference between successful traders and those who blow up their accounts? Risk management.

## The Golden Rules

### 1. Never Risk More Than 2% Per Trade
This is the most important rule. Even with a 50% win rate, you can be profitable long-term.

### 2. Use Stop Losses Always
Set your stop loss before you enter the trade. Emotions run high when money is on the line.

### 3. Position Sizing Matters
Calculate your position size based on your stop loss distance and risk per trade.

**Formula:**
\`\`\`
Position Size = (Account Risk %) / (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)
\`\`\`

### 4. Diversify Your Trades
Don't put all your risk in one asset or sector. Spread it across different opportunities.

## AI-Powered Risk Management

HeliconTrade's AI helps with:

- **Automatic position sizing** based on your risk preferences
- **Dynamic stop losses** that adjust with market volatility
- **Portfolio correlation analysis** to avoid over-concentration
- **Risk alerts** when you're approaching your limits

## Common Risk Management Mistakes

1. **Moving stop losses** in the wrong direction
2. **Risking too much** on "sure thing" trades
3. **Not having a plan** before entering trades
4. **Ignoring correlation** between positions

Remember: You can't control the market, but you can control your risk!`,
