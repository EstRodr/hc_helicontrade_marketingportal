## 3. Internationalization (i18n) Strategy

### 🌐 Recommended Approach: Hybrid Model

#### **Code-Based i18n** (Primary Approach)
```
/locales/
├── en.json          # English (default)
├── fr.json          # French
├── es.json          # Spanish
├── de.json          # German
├── ja.json          # Japanese
└── ar.json          # Arabic
```

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Faster initial load times
- 🔒 Type safety and validation
- 🚀 Better developer experience
- 📦 Bundled with application code

#### **CMS-Based i18n** (Content-Specific)
```
Strapi Multi-locale Support for:
├── Marketing content
├── Blog articles
├── News updates
├── Legal documents
└── Educational resources
```

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Example: Mixed approach
const { t } = useI18n()                    // Code-based UI strings
const content = await getLocalizedContent() // CMS-based content

// UI Elements (fast, cached)
const buttonText = t('buttons.get_started')

// Content (dynamic, multi-locale)
const features = await getFeatures(locale)
```

### 🎯 Language Priority Rollout

**Phase 1: Foundation** 
- ✅ English (Default)
- 🔄 French (EU Market)
- 🔄 Spanish (LatAm Market)

**Phase 2: Expansion**
- German (DACH Region)
- Japanese (Asian Markets)
- Arabic (Middle East)

**Phase 3: Growth Markets**
- Portuguese (Brazil)
- Italian (Southern Europe)
- Korean (Asia Pacific)
